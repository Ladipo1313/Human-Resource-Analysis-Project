Data Cleaning Process

Our approach to ensuring the integrity of the data involved a multi-step process, conducted with meticulous attention to detail and precision:

Data Splitting: The initial step involved splitting the data columns to address the issue of disorganization and inconsistency.

Header Standardization: We utilized the first row as the header for the dataset to provide a consistent and structured foundation for analysis.

Data Quality Assurance: We meticulously scrutinized the data to guarantee its cleanliness, accuracy, and adherence to a standardized format.

Promotion Eligibility Identification: Conditional columns were added to identify employees due for promotion and those who were not.

Measures Table: A dedicated measure table was created to house all relevant calculations and measures.

DAX Expressions: Complex DAX expressions were employed to address specific organizational queries and challenges.
